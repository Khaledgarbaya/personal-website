Numbered bookmarks will allow us to select a block of code, bookmark it and easily navigate back to it using the bookmark number.

In this lesson, you will learn how to use the Numbered Bookmarks extension to navigate your code faster.

Keyboard Shortcuts
The default keyboard shortcut for adding a code bookmark is `cmd+shift+#` where `#` is a number from 0 to 9, This might interfere with other system's keyboard shortcuts like taking a screenshot cmd+shift+4 and cmd+shift+4. You can change the default one to `shift+alt+#`.

To navigate bookmarks you can use cmd+# where # is your bookmark number.
