Eleventy, or 11ty, is a powerful yet straightforward static site generator. It does not require any config to get started.
This what it will take you to get an 11ty project running:

```sh
npm install -g @11ty/eleventy
echo '# Page header' > README.md
eleventy
```

## Bootstrap an eleventy project

<div style={{ position: "relative" }}>
  <div style={{ height: "0px", paddingBottom: "56.25%" }}>
    <iframe
      src="https://app.egghead.io/lessons/11ty-bootstrap-an-eleventy-project/embed?preload=false&af=eq272d"
      allowfullscreen
      style={{
        position: "absolute",
        width: "100%",
        height: "100%",
        top: "0px",
        left: "0px",
        border: "none",
        borderRadius: "4px",
      }}
    ></iframe>
  </div>
</div>

We'll start from an empty directory, initialize it as an npm package by calling `npm init -y`. Install @11ty/eleventy, `npm i -D @11ty/eleventy`, package and create the website entry point.
Eleventy can compile multiple file formats, HTML, markdown, liquid, and njk.

## Eleventy Layouts

<div style={{ position: "relative" }}>
  <div style={{ height: "0px", paddingBottom: "56.25%" }}>
    <iframe
      src="https://app.egghead.io/lessons/11ty-use-eleventy-layouts/embed?preload=false&af=eq272d"
      allowfullscreen
      style={{
        position: "absolute",
        width: "100%",
        height: "100%",
        top: "0px",
        left: "0px",
        border: "none",
        borderRadius: "4px",
      }}
    ></iframe>
  </div>
</div>

Eleventy Layouts are special templates that you can use to wrap other content. For more information, check the layouts docs.

Layouts will live in an \_includes folder at the root of your project. For example, if you want to share a standard structure through all your blog posts page first, you need to create a file inside the \_includes folder and give it a name; let's call it `mylayout.njk`.

Add the wrapping HTML code.

```html
---
title: My Website
---

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>{{ title }}</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- any page content that uses this layout goes here-->
    {{ content | safe}}
  </body>
</html>
```

To use a layout, you need to specify the frontmatter `layout` property inside the desired file. In this case, it will `post.md` at the root level of the project.

```md
---
layout: mainlayout.njk
title: My First Post
tags: post
---

## My First Post
```

Layouts in eleventy can use other layouts. You can also use a different template engine across layouts. This feature is convenient if we want to wrap some pages with extra markup but not all the pages.

<div style={{ position: "relative" }}>
  <div style={{ height: "0px", paddingBottom: "56.25%" }}>
    <iframe
      src="https://app.egghead.io/lessons/11ty-use-layout-chaining-in-eleventy/embed?preload=false&af=eq272d"
      allowfullscreen
      style={{
        position: "absolute",
        width: "100%",
        height: "100%",
        top: "0px",
        left: "0px",
        border: "none",
        borderRadius: "4px",
      }}
    ></iframe>
  </div>
</div>

## Create pages from data in Eleventy

<div style={{ position: "relative" }}>
  <div style={{ height: "0px", paddingBottom: "56.25%" }}>
    <iframe
      src="https://app.egghead.io/lessons/11ty-create-pages-from-data-in-eleventy/embed?preload=false&af=eq272d"
      allowfullscreen
      style={{
        position: "absolute",
        width: "100%",
        height: "100%",
        top: "0px",
        left: "0px",
        border: "none",
        borderRadius: "4px",
      }}
    ></iframe>
  </div>
</div>

Eleventy supports a few data sources, JSON, and js files.
Let's take the example of creating pages from a list of pokemon in a JSON file.

First, create a `_data` folder at the root of your project, then create a `pokemons.json` file inside the newly created folder.

```json
[
  {
    "name": "Pikachu",
    "power": "Static"
  },
  {
    "name": "Charizard",
    "power": "fire"
  }
]
```

Now create a file `pokemon-page.njk` at the root of your project.
To make use of the data, you can use the frontmatter property `pagination`. Pagination has some sub-props:

- data this can the name of the file inside the \_data directory; in your case, it should be `pokemons`
- size where you can specify the size of the page it is usually 1
- alias, which will be the name of a current item in the list.

Every page will need a unique slug to construct the final URL. You can achieve that by using the permalink property. You can use the pokemon.name and pass it through the `slug` eleventy filter.

```html
---
pagination:
  data: pokemons
  size: 1
  alias: pokemon
permalink: "pokemons/{{ pokemon.name | slug}}/"
tags: pokemonPage
title: { { pokemon.name } }
---

<p>Name: {{ pokemon.name }}</p>
<p>Power: {{ pokemon.power }}</p>
```
