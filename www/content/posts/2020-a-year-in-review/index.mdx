title: 2020 A year in review
description: This year, 2020, was crazy, unusual, and maybe we will talk about it for years to come. I am very grateful that my family and I are safe. 2020 is also the year that we had our first baby, a lovely baby girl. Throughout the year, I’ve released a decent amount of educational content focusing more on the JAMstack.

This year, 2020, was crazy, unusual, and maybe we will talk about it for years to come. I am very grateful that my family and I are safe. 2020 is also the year that we had our first baby, a lovely baby girl. Throughout the year, I’ve released a decent amount of educational content focusing more on the JAMstack.

## TLDR;

* Videos: 45 YouTube videos
* Blog posts: 3 blog posts
* Courses: 1 big course and four mini-courses/collections, a total of 28 videos
* Side Projects: https://tldreact.dev, https://learnjamstack.com
* Twitch Streams: around 40+ stream

## Content I released

My main focus was JAMstack and building a complete project from start to finish. Not the classic blog post or todo app but real-world saas Apps using Gatsbyjs, Netlify, Contentful, and the JAMstack friends.

Most of the content was in the form of videos. I started the year with a challenge, pushing the JAMstack to its limit, so I started building a Saas App called  [rubbergoose.dev](https://rubbergoose.de/) . Throughout 23 streams, I created a complete App that uses Netlify Identity, Stripe, Twillio videos, and much more hot new tech. You can find all the videos in this YouTube  [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYqJWpV7HaI&list=PL8KiuH6vpACWZ7989jU1Puil5P2_m2O8e) . The code is also opensource over at  [Github](https://github.com/Khaledgarbaya/rubbergoose) .

Continuing with the live stream, I also did 13 random ones covering different topics like working on my  [website](https://khaledgarbaya.net/) , Setting up my dev environment, exploring other frameworks/tools like eleventy, Gatsby recipes, and answering some people’s questions about Contentful.

Compared to video production, I did very poorly in writing blog posts, which I will try to improve in 2021 (famous last word). I wrote a piece about how to use  [Gatsby as a replacement for create-react-app](https://khaledgarbaya.net/articles/gatsby-as-a-replacement-for-create-react-app) . The goal was not to talk about this vs. that but to showcase Gatsby’s power and how you can build real-world apps with it. The  [second blog post](https://khaledgarbaya.net/articles/getting-started-with-gatsbyjs-recipes)  I wrote is a deep dive into Gatsby recipes and how you can create your own. Consider it the written version of my egghead  [mini-course](https://egghead.io/playlists/getting-started-with-gatsbyjs-recipes-c79a??af=eq272d). I also wrote another blog post on [gatsby.com](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/blog/2020-07-20-khaled-garbaya-life-after-recipes) about life Before and After Gatsby Recipes.

Now courses, With the help of  [egghead.io](https://egghead.io/) , I produced the following:
*  [Eject create-react-app and Use Gatsby for Advanced React App Development](https://egghead.io/courses/eject-create-react-app-and-use-gatsby-for-advanced-react-app-development?af=eq272d) 
*  [Create a Figma Plugin Using Typescript](https://egghead.io/playlists/create-a-figma-plugin-16d5?af=eq272d) 
*  [Getting Started with Eleventy](https://egghead.io/playlists/getting-started-with-eleventy-53c2?af=eq272d) 
*  [Getting Started with Gatsbyjs recipes](https://egghead.io/playlists/getting-started-with-gatsbyjs-recipes-c79a?af=eq272d) 
*  [Getting Started with Blitz.js](https://egghead.io/playlists/getting-started-with-blitz-js-0585?af=eq272d) 

## Side projects

I probably start 34897 side projects, but I will talk only about the ones I released.

I released  [learnjamstack](https://learnjamstack.com/) , a curated list of courses, articles, and tips about JAMstack.The main thing you get from this project is a weekly email with great jamstack resources, or what I thought is cool.

I released  [tldreact.dev](https://tldreact.dev/) , quick and easy React snippets that you’re always looking for but never find. Most of the time, when working with React, I find myself scanning a tutorial directly for the code and skipping all the explanations and fluff because I don’t need it, so I made tldreact.dev just for that use case.
