When building a grid layout with cards, you may want the cards to have the same height to create a consistent and visually appealing design. In this post, we will explore how to create a responsive grid layout with cards that have the same height using Tailwindcss.

## Creating a grid layout with cards

```html
<div class="grid auto-rows-fr grid-cols-3 gap-2">
  <div class="rounded bg-slate-100 p-3">This has some content.</div>
  <div class="rounded bg-slate-100 p-3">
    This has more content so that its significantly larger than the other
    items. Yet all items, even the one in the new line will grow to the
    size of the highest container.
  </div>
  <div class="rounded bg-slate-100 p-3">More content.</div>
  <div class="rounded bg-slate-100 p-3">First item in new line.</div>
</div>
```
The important part here is `auto-rows-fr` which will make sure that all the items in the grid will have the same height.
