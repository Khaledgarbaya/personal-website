        Where do I start? I'm Khaled Garbaya, born and raised in a small town
        in the south of Tunisia. Tunisia, a beautiful country in North Africa,
        is known for its rich history, diverse culture, and stunning
        landscapes. Ironically, it wasn't until I secured a job that I gained
        a deeper understanding of my country, as I could now afford to travel
        extensively. Don't get me wrong, my parents did their best to show me
        around, but we would only travel to places where we had relatives,
        leading to a repetitive experience. It was the only option we could
        afford, and I appreciate every moment.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let's move on from that topic. I completed my schooling in my hometown
        before attending a university located 20 km away in the same state. I
        did a bachelor degree in computer science. Meanwhile, my passion for
        programming was growing and growing every day since I discovered
        GBasic, a programming language on my Atari keyboard console with
        cartridge. I can't recall the exact brand and model, but if you're old
        enough, you'll remember it. My first program was `PRINT Khaled`, and
        guess what? My name was printed. I then began researching loops and
        other related topics.
      </p>
      <p>
        The second and probably the biggest motivator was getting introduced
        to Macromedia Flash, acquired by Adobe later. I was amazed by the
        possibilities and how it is almost guaranteed that it will work in
        every browser; back then, Javascript was mostly used to show an alert.
      </p>
      <p>
        Anyway, after finishing university, I immediately got a job as a flash
        developer for an agency in the capital Tunis. As a student, I
        developed a portfolio that included several Flash websites for various
        businesses and non-profits in my hometown. After a few years, Flash's
        popularity began to decline due to security issues arising from its
        use as a virtual machine (VM), with Steve Jobs's open letter likely
        serving as the final straw. I am deeply grateful for the platform, as
        it not only covered my expenses for many years but also taught me
        invaluable Javascript concepts.
      </p>
      <p>
        After transitioning to Javascript and later Nodejs, I moved to Berlin.
        I began working on full-stack development and contributed to
        open-source projects such as Yargs and Gatsby, a process I thoroughly
        enjoyed. I also experimented with videos, streaming, and writing. I
        still do this casually.
      </p>
      <p>
        After spending over a decade coding, I moved to management not because
        "it's the next natural thing" but more because I really love helping
        empower people and seeing them succeed. As a result, I transitioned to
        management, which was initially challenging because it required me to
        relearn everything about people I had learned as an IC.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a family man, raising a child has become my new hobby. I love
        spending time with my small family and try to keep a balance between
        work and life; after all, work will never end, but time with the
        people you love will.
